Completed the Task given by the team of Codes for Tomorrow


Use Redux for pagination, data fetching and displaying of the cards 
Use Vite react for the front-end displaying
Use Tailwind CSS for the styling property
Use the Flowbite website for the building of Card Component.

IMPORTANT !!!! The API provided doesn't have any images so I used a random image from my Own.
